\arguments{
\item{x}{an object inheriting from class \code{\link[lcc]{lcc}},
representing a fitted longitudinal concordance correlation
function.}

\item{which}{if a subset of the plots is required, specify a subset
of the numbers from 1 to 6.}

\item{caption}{captions to appear above the plots. Vector or list of
valid graphics annotations is required. All captions can be
supressed using '""' or \code{NA}.}

\item{sub.caption}{common sub-title (at bottom). Default to
\code{NULL}.}

\item{main}{The main title (on top) above the caption.}

\item{panel}{panel function. If \code{add.smooth = TRUE},
\code{panel.smooth} is used rather than \code{points}.}

\item{add.smooth}{logical indicating if smoother should be added to
most plots; see also \code{panel} above. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{ask}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, the default, the user is _ask_ed
before each plot, see \code{\link[graphics]{par}}.}

\item{id.n}{number of points to be labelled is the first three
plots, starting with the most extreme.}

\item{labels.id}{vector of labels, from which the labels for extreme
points will be chosen. Default to \code{NULL} (uses observation
numbers).}

\item{label.pos}{positioning of labels, for the left half and right
half of the graph respectively, for plots 1-3.}

\item{cex.id}{magnification of point label.}

\item{cex.caption}{controls the size of \code{caption}.}

\item{cex.oma.man}{controls the size of the \code{sub.caption} only
if that is _above_ the figures when there is more than one.}

\item{...}{further graphical parameters from 'par'.}
}
\description{
Diagnostic plots for conditional error and random
effects from the linear mixed-effects fit are obtained. Six plots
plots (selectable by 'which') are currently available: a plot of
residuals against fitted values, a plot of residuals against
time variable, a boxplot of residuals by subject,
a plot of observerd values against fitted values, a normal Q-Q plot
with simulation envelopes based on conditional error,  and a normal
Q-Q plot with simulation envelopes based on the random effects. By
default, all plots are provided.
}
\details{
The Q-Q plot uses the normalized residuals. The
  standardized residuals is pre-multiplied by the inverse
  square-root factor of the estimated error correlation matrix while
  the random effects is pre-multiplied by the inverse square root of
  the estimated variances obtained from matrix G. The simulate
  envelopes are obtained from package hnp (Moral et al.,  2018).
